    "Flask is a web framework that allows developers to build lightweight web applications quickly and easily with Flask Libraries. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, leader of the International Group of Python Enthusiasts(POCCO). It is basically based on the WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 templating engine.\n",
    "ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "Advantages of Flask:\n",
    "1.\t Flask is a lightweight backend framework with minimal dependencies.\n",
    "2.\t Flask is easy to learn because its simple and intuitive API makes it easy to learn and use for beginners.\n",
    "3.\t Flask is a flexible Framework because it allows you to customize and extend the framework to suit your needs easily.\n",
    "4.\t Flask can be used with any database like:- SQL and NoSQL and with any Frontend Technology such as React or Angular.\n",
    "5.\tFlask is great for small to medium projects that do not require the complexity of a large framework.\n"

    "2.\tSimplicity: Modern web frameworks use more meaningful URLs to help users remember the URLs and make navigation simpler14.\n",
    "3.\tDirect Access: It is useful to access the desired page directly without having to navigate from the home page4.\n",
    "4.\tDynamic URLs: We can also build dynamic URLs by using variables in the URL1. For example, @app.route('/user/<username>') would map any URL of the form “/user/some_name” to the show_user function, with some_name passed as an argument\n"
